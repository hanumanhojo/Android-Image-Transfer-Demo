# android-image-transfer-demo

This app allows images to be streamed from an nRF52 kit with a connected camera sensor to the application, showing the image and measuring the transfer speed in the process. 

Different image resolutions can be selected in the app, and the BLE phy can be changed between 1Mbps and 2Mbps to demonstrate the difference (this requires a phone that supports 2Mbps). 

Tested on:   
- Google Pixel XL
	- Up to 500kbps speed
- HTC One M8
	- Up to 63kbps speed
- Samsung Galaxy S8 
	- Up to 1200kbps speed          
- Samsung Galaxy S6 (1Mbps mode only)
	- Up to 90kbps speed

### Note
- Android 4.3 or later is required.
- Android Studio supported
